[Live Application](https://markdown-previewer-dlzl.surge.sh)

### Project Goals

1. User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.

2. User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.

3. Hint: You don't need to interpret Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked
